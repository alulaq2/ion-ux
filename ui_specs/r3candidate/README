This is a temporary dir to stash the FMP files needed to deploy r3 UI changes.
They should eventually make their way into production.

The master ciux specifications*.fp7 file is not included.  At least for now.

See https://confluence.oceanobservatories.org/display/CIDev/OOINet+UX+Release+Process
for deployment details.

In case a developer wants to include these changes before they are officially deployed,
the preload command will look something like this for alpha data (swap out the full 
ui_path to match your own):

  bin/pycc -x ion.processes.bootstrap.ion_loader.IONLoader \
    cfg=res/preload/r2_ioc/config/ooi_alpha.yml \
    path=master ui_path='/home/ooi/code/ion-ux/ui_specs/r3candidate'
